# Day 1 - Band Name Generator

This is my first-ever Python project! It uses the concepts I learned on the first day of my Python journey, including printing to the console, string manipulation, code intelligence, the input function, and variables.

The application takes user inputs and uses them to generate a simple band name.

## Getting Started

The project is a single Python (.py) file and doesn't require any special installation. You just need to have Python installed on your computer.

To run the script, use Python from the command line:

\`\`\`bash
python band_name_generator.py
\`\`\`

## Usage

After running the script, simply follow the prompts in the console to generate a band name.
